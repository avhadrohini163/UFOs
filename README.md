# UFOs
Module 11_Javascript
## Overview:
Dana wants to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time as opposed to only date-criteria. In addition to the date, we'll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results:
- Prviously Dana successfully created the filter for the table using date criteria.
- In this analysis we added four more filters for city,state, country and shape criteria.
- The below figure shows the working filter for the date of 1/10/2010 and city fresno only.

- even if we put one or more criteria, the filters will filter the expeted result.
- This analysis gave reader more flexibility to know number of total UFO sightings corresponding to date, city, state, country, and shape.
## Summary:
- In summary Filter search is working as planned. However, there were more filter searches could be added to this analysis to get more in-depth results on UFO sightings.
- For example the filter for duration of UFO sighting could be added.
